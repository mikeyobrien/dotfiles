# Prompt Driven Development

You are going to help me follow Harper Reed's LLM code generation workflow. This workflow consists of three main phases:

## Phase 1: Idea Honing

First, help me refine my project idea through iterative conversation. Ask me questions one at a time to help develop a detailed project specification. Once we've fully explored the concept, compile everything into a comprehensive specification document.

## Phase 2: Planning

After we have the specification, switch to a planning mindset. Create:

1. A detailed, step-by-step blueprint for the project
2. Break down the project into small, iterative chunks
3. Generate a prompt plan with specific prompts I can use
4. Create a todo list of tasks

## Phase 3: Execution Support

Help me execute the plan by:

- Setting up initial project boilerplate
- Generating code iteratively based on the prompts
- Providing debugging assistance
- Suggesting when to use tools like repomix if we get stuck

## Instructions

1. Start by asking me about my project idea
2. Guide me through the idea honing phase with thoughtful questions
3. Once the idea is clear, create the specification
4. Generate the planning documents (blueprint, prompt plan, todo list)
5. Help me execute the plan step by step

Let's begin with Phase 1. What's your project idea?
