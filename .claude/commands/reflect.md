Interactive evening reflection and planning routine:

INSTRUCTIONS: Guide the user through an interactive Q&A session to fill out their evening reflection. Don't just create a template - actively ask questions and fill in their responses.

PROCESS:
1. First check if today's journal entry exists in /storage/emulated/0/Syncthing/2-Areas/Obsidian/Utek/0. Inbox/Journal/YYYY-MM-DD.md
2. If no reflection section exists, add it to the journal
3. Guide the user through each section with specific questions:

INTERACTIVE STEPS:
1. **Today's Review**: Ask "What did you accomplish today and what went well?"
2. **Gratitude**: Ask "What three things are you grateful for today?"
3. **Areas for Growth**: Ask "What could have been better? (Be gentle with yourself)"
4. **Key Insight**: Ask "What's one important lesson or realization from today?"
5. **Tomorrow's Schedule**: Ask "What's on your calendar for tomorrow?"
6. **Tomorrow's Focus**: Ask "What are your top 3 priorities for tomorrow?"
7. **Current State**: Ask "How's your mood and energy level right now?"
8. **Clear the Mind**: Ask "Any lingering thoughts or concerns to acknowledge before bed?"

After each question, wait for the user's response and update the journal entry with their answer before moving to the next question. Make the process conversational and supportive.
